## 🧠 How I Approached It

This project was built to explore:

-React fundamentals: useState, useEffect, props, and component-based architecture.

-Search & API handling: I implemented a debounced search using the OMDb API for smooth user experience.

-Watchlist logic: Add/remove functionality with unique ID checks and localStorage for persistence.

-Responsive design: Used CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries to ensure a mobile-friendly UI.

The overall focus was on interactivity, code reusability, and maintaining a clean, modern UI/UX.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-Frontend: React, CSS (Flexbox, Grid)

-Drag-and-drop: react-beautiful-dnd

-API: OMDb API

-State management: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

-Persistence: localStorage
