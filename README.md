This project was built as part of a frontend assignment and focuses on learning and applying:

React Fundamentals
useState, useEffect, props, and component-based architecture for modularity

Search & API Handling
Debounced search implementation using OMDb API for efficient querying and better UX

Watchlist Logic
Add/remove with unique ID validation and persistent state via localStorage

Responsive Design
Layout structured with CSS Flexbox, Grid, and media queries for a seamless mobile experience

The overall goal was to build a user-friendly, interactive, and maintainable application.
